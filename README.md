## Currently working features

- Item List of all SkyBlock Items
- Recipe Viewer for Crafting Recipes
- Recipe Viewer for Forge Recipes
- ... as well as many more custom recipe types.
- NPC waypoints
- A storage overview as well as a full storage overlay
- A crafting overlay when clicking the "Move Item" plus in a crafting recipe
- Cursor position saver
- Slot locking
- Support for custom texture packs (loads item models from `firmskyblock:<skyblock id>` before the vanilla model gets
  loaded)
- Fairy soul highlighter
- A hud editor powered by [Jarvis](https://github.com/romangraef/jarvis)
- Basic Config Gui (/firm config). Still needs improvement, but for the basics it's enough. You can also
  use `/jarvis options` to search through all config options
- and more (maintaining a feature list properly is a task for the future).

## Installation

Firnauhi needs the following libraries to work:

- [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api)
- [Fabric Language Kotlin](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-language-kotlin)
 
As well as (for the item list):
- 
- [RoughlyEnoughItems](https://modrinth.com/mod/rei)
- [Architectury](https://modrinth.com/mod/architectury-api)
- [Cloth Config](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config)


You can download Firnauhi itself on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/firnauhi) or on
[GitHub](https://github.com/romangraef/firnauhi/releases).

### Usage

Everything is configurable via either `/firm config`, or via `/jarvis options`.

### Recommendations

- [DulkirMod-Fabric](https://github.com/inglettronald/DulkirMod-fabric), a versatile SkyBlock mod.
- [Skyblocker](https://modrinth.com/mod/skyblocker-liap), a very feature rich SkyBlock mod.
- [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) and [Lithium](https://modrinth.com/mod/lithium), both excellent performance mods.
- [ModMenu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu), just to see which mods you have installed, and to configure some of them.
